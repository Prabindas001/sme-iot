# SME-IoT Library

![SME-IoT logo](images/sme-iot-logo.png)

The SME-IoT library is a collection of functions for reading common sensors and performing Internet of Things (IoT) tasks using the Arduino platform. The library is designed to help students and laypersons easily interface with various sensors and devices to create their own IoT projects.

## Features

- Read common sensors like LM35, IR, and more.
- Control actuators like LEDs, motors, and relays.
- Connect to Wi-Fi and send data to IoT platforms like ThingSpeak and Adafruit IO.
- Display sensor data on OLED and LCD displays.
- And more!

## Installation

To use the SME-IoT library, you need to install it in the Arduino IDE. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...**.
3. In the search box, type `SME-IoT`.
4. Select the `SME-IoT` library and click the **Install** button.
5. Wait for the installation to complete.
6. You're ready to use the SME-IoT library!

## Usage

To use the SME-IoT library in your Arduino sketch, you need to include its header file at the top of your sketch:

```cpp
#include <sme-iot.h>


#include <sme-iot.h>

SMEIoT smeiot;

void setup() {
  // Initialize the SMEIoT library.
  smeiot.begin();
}

void loop() {
  // Read the LM35 sensor on pin A0.
  float temperature = smeiot.readLM35(A0);

  // Send the temperature to ThingSpeak.
  smeiot.sendThingSpeak(temperature);

  // Wait 10 seconds.
  delay(10000);
}
